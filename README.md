# Blog Posts

Blog Posts is a React.js project which has 3 sections, namely Home, Post, About. I used [Easy Peasy](https://easy-peasy.dev/docs/introduction/) for state management and localStorage of browser for persistence of states. You will be able to view your blogs even when you close and reopen your browser. You can add blogs by clicking on the Post in the navigation bar. The current limit of localStorage is around 5MB, which should be sufficient.
